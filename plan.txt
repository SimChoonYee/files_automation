Training plan:
1) unzip
2) extract
3) read config file
    3.1) create a list fo attributes for config parser to take.
    Why we need this?

    Each file should have attributes such as:
    1. path to replace
    2. filename
    3. path it exists
    Where should i put this attributes?

4) update/remove/create


Move forward plan:
1) Use property now to filter the config https://pythonguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/decorator.html
